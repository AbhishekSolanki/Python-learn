This document contains the description and concept of "self" in PY

1. 
==
Let's say you have a class ClassA which contains a method methodA defined as:

def methodA(self, arg1, arg2):
    #do something
and ObjectA is an instance of this class.

Now when ObjectA.methodA(arg1, arg2) is called, python internally converts it for you as:

ClassA.methodA(ObjectA, arg1, arg2)

The self variable refers to the object itself.

Its use is nearly the same as that of this keyword in Java, i.e. to give a reference to the current object.
