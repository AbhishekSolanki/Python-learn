 Jigar:  and yes...when you calculate time for python program it will be in seconds
 me:  okay...ic
 Jigar:  not ms...ms when we are using time calcaulation differently 
 me:  accha
 Sent at 15:55 on Sunday
 me:  i used
import time
start_time = time.time()
main()
print("--- %s seconds -" % time.time() - start_time)
and got
0.0160000324249
 Jigar:  yup! 
 me:  the code "timing.py" which you send shows only start time
so its normal or its taking too much time
 Jigar:  which file?
 me:  there is a code name "timing.py"  in the above link you send
so it is 16ms :-(
 Jigar:  arayyyy.......tension mat le
this is not only time for your program
its include cpu extra time
